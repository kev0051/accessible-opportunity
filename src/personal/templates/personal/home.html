      class="fs-5 text-muted">Our team is funded by UNT to set up an application allowing persons of all disabilities to find jobs and/or research opportunities. This will be implemented through a website where employers can browse potential employee profiles, and users can network by making posts, sending messages, and updating their profiles/documents. This will function similarly to a LinkedIn, but with an accessibility overhaul.
